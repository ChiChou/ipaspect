## Setup

### Desktop requirements:

* Latest [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=7.10.1) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to run the api server and web gui
* Any modern desktop browser you like

Passionfruit is now avaliable on npm, so just type following command to install:

```shell
npm install -g passionfruit
```

Then launch it:

```shell
passionfruit
```

Note that if the port 31337 is in use, set environment variable `PORT` to use an alternative port. Also, setting `HOST` can force to listen on an alternative interface, but be careful because it has no authentication yet:

```
HOST=192.168.1.100 PORT=12345 passionfruit
```

**Security Warning**

Passionfruit does not support authentication now, so any one that have access to the web page may control your connected devices!

### Device setup:

#### Jailbroken Device

See https://www.frida.re/docs/ios/

> Start `Cydia` and add Frida’s repository by going to `Manage` -> `Sources` -> `Edit` -> `Add` and enter `https://build.frida.re`. You should now be able to find and install the `Frida` package which lets Frida inject JavaScript into apps running on your iOS device. This happens over USB, so you will need to have your USB cable handy, though there’s no need to plug it in just yet.

#### Non-jailbroken Device

Official documentation of frida.re (linked above) also introduces how to inject [FridaGadget.dylib](https://build.frida.re/frida/ios/lib/FridaGadget.dylib) to the ipa, requires repack and resign.

Here are some articles about how to do so:

* [MonkeyDev/wiki/非越狱App集成#集成frida](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/MonkeyDev/wiki/%E9%9D%9E%E8%B6%8A%E7%8B%B1App%E9%9B%86%E6%88%90#集成frida)（Chinese)

* https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2016/october/ios-instrumentation-without-jailbreak/

## Development setup

Clone this project and install requirements:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/chaitin/passionfruit.git
npm install
```

For those who wants to contribute, you may probably need to restart the api server and reload webpage each time you make a change. The following steps enable livereload.

**Will start three shells simultaneously.**

```shell
npm run dev
```

Browser will be open (http://localhost:8080)

## FAQ

### Why node.js is complaining about syntax error?

This project uses the lastest ECMAScript feature in server side. You need nodejs v7.10.1 at least, but v8.x and above is recommended. I've got some users reporting that yarn is not compatible with lower nodejs version.

### "Device is not an iOS device, or you have not installed frida on it"

Make sure you have frida.re successfully installed. Also, check if the version on of frida on device matches. Frida offers both 32bit and 64bit version, wrong architecture will not work.

### Have problem with `npm install`?

Users from China mainland may encounter network problem. Try npm mirrors like [cnpm](https://npm.taobao.org/). But some prebuilt packages may still need to be downloaded from GitHub, a reliable proxy would help.

All npm command mentioned above can be replaced with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), if you prefer.

Besides, after updating source with `git pull`, or having nodejs engine upgraded, you may need to remove `node_modules` directory and re-run `npm install`.

### "Error: Ambiguous name; it matches: ..."

The app you're trying to attach has multiple processes, and frida couldn't decide which one to inject. You can try terminate the app via device gesture.
